What you see on a Pool page

- TVL (USD): Total value in the pool, shown so you can compare pools.
- Your deposit: If you connect a wallet, Votion shows your deposited value and share of the pool.
- APY: Estimated yearly return shown for convenience.

How compounding is presented

Votion shows expected rewards for a reporting period and a converted APY. If you reinvest rewards, your effective returns may increase; the app shows an estimate assuming rewards are added to the pool value.
