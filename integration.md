Integration with Liquidity Alliance and Hydro

Votion supports both Liquidity Alliance and Hydro pools. For end users this means:

- Pools from both ecosystems appear in the app when available.
- Vote recommendations account for the specific rules of each ecosystem so you don't have to handle differences manually.

What to expect

- If a pool belongs to Liquidity Alliance, Votion shows the pool name and rewards specific to that program.
- If a pool belongs to Hydro, Votion will surface Hydro-specific labels and rewards.

If you need help with a specific pool, open the pool page and check the notes and warnings shown there.
