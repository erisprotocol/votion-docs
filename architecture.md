Simple explanation for users

Votion watches pools and reward programs and calculates suggested vote allocations to help you increase expected rewards. The app:

- Gathers reward information from the pools
- Estimates expected USD rewards for different vote distributions
- Shows you a simple recommendation and how much extra USD you might earn

That's it â€” Votion aims to take the hard math out of voting so you can make informed decisions quickly.
